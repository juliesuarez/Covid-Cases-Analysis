# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker 
# Description

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of global COVID-19 data. Using Python and popular data science libraries, this notebook loads, cleans, analyzes, and visualizes trends in cases, deaths, and vaccinations across different countries. The final output is a data-driven report that communicates key insights through narrative text and clear visualizations.
This project was developed using Google Colab.

# Data Source
The analysis is based on the Our World in Data (OWID) COVID-19 dataset, a comprehensive and regularly updated resource that aggregates data from various official sources.
Source: Our World in Data-https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sandhyakrishnan02/latest-covid-19-dataset-worldwide?resource=download
File Used: owid-covid-data.csv

# Features
Data Loading and Cleaning: Loads the dataset and prepares it for analysis by handling missing values and converting data types.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Investigates trends for total cases, deaths, and new cases over time.
Comparative Analysis: Filters and compares key metrics for a selected list of countries (Kenya, USA, India, UK, Brazil).
Vaccination Tracking: Visualizes the progress of vaccination rollouts.
Geospatial Visualization: Creates an interactive choropleth map to show the global distribution of cases per million people.

# Tools and Libraries Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
# Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
# Matplotlib & Seaborn: For creating static charts and graphs (line plots, bar charts).
# Plotly Express: For creating interactive geospatial maps.
Environment: Google Colab
